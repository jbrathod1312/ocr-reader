"""
Read a receipt with PP-OCR and emit word boxes as JSON.

Why this exists outside the browser app
---------------------------------------
The app reads these receipts with Tesseract. Its remaining errors are all
character-level and all where the watermark has thinned the print: `/` read as
`1` in a settled date, `8` as `6` in an amount, `L/T` as `LIT`. That is the
failure mode a model trained on photographs is least prone to, so PP-OCR is
worth trying — but wiring it into the browser is blocked on OpenCV.js, which
wedges the main thread for minutes on a 10 MB synchronous WASM init and never
recovers. There is no such problem here.

What this deliberately does NOT do
----------------------------------
Assemble rows. It stops at word boxes; `python/reader/` takes them from there —
glyphs joined, columns found, rows built, the receipt's own checks run. Keeping
the recogniser at the boundary means a PDF's own text and a scan's words enter
the same builders, and only the recognising is paid for when a page needs it.
