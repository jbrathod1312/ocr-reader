"""
Join the glyphs a recogniser returned one at a time.

Why this is needed: a recogniser is free to box each glyph
separately, and on a line-printer face it usually does — `144732` comes back
as `1 4 4 7 3 2`. Everything downstream reads the layout from where words
start and the gaps between them, so a word cut into six pieces is six column
starts and five spaces that were never printed.

The three gaps on a printed line are an order apart — no gap within a word,
about a character between words, several between columns — so glyphs are
joined below a fraction of a character and a word space survives.

    Each word's box cut down to the ink inside it.

    A recogniser gives a line as one box and shares it out among the words, spaces
    and all, so neighbouring words touch and the gaps that separate one column from
    the next are gone. A PDF's words have real gaps, and everything downstream that
    tells a column's end from a word space reads them. Cutting a word's box to its
    own ink puts the gaps back: the same page, set down the same way, whether it
    came as text or as pixels.
