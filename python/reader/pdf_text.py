"""
A PDF's own text, in the pixels of the page as rendered.

This replaces what pdf.js did in the browser. The app rasterises a page at
200 dpi and reads the text layer in that same pixel space, so that a word box
from the text layer and a word box from the recogniser mean the same thing and
the readers above need not know which one they were given.

PyMuPDF reports a word's ink box where pdf.js reported its advance, so a box
here is a pixel or two narrower than the one the browser produced. Nothing
downstream measures a single box against an absolute size — every rule is a
ratio against the page's own character or line — so the readings agree; the
corpus harness is what says so.
