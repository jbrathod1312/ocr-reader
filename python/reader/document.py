"""
A whole document in, the finished reading out.

This is what the browser used to do for itself: rasterise a PDF, read its text
layer, fall back to a recogniser where there is none, and assemble the rows.
It lives here now so that the app has one reader rather than two, and the page
decides nothing.

A page is read from the PDF's own text where it has one, because that text is
exact and a recogniser's is not. A scan, a photograph, or a PDF whose text
layer is a token has to be recognised, and only those pages pay for it.

The column edges a page settles are carried to the page after it, as they were
in the browser: a long invoice prints its titles once and the pages that
follow have only the rows.
