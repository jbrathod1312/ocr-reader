"""
The whole document as one export: every page's rows, in page order.

A port of what used to be `frontend/src/lib/export.ts`. It is here rather than
in the browser so that the export is the reader's answer and not the page's
rendering of it: a script, another service and the app all ask for the same
CSV and get the same bytes.

A multi-page invoice is one table printed across pages, so its export is one
table too, with each row's page kept beside it. A single image or a one-page
PDF exports exactly as the page does.
